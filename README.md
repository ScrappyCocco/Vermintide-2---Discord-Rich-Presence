Make sure you have **already installed the Vermintide Mod Framework**, you can download it [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1369573612). Check that it's the first mod loaded in the launcher.

Finally, install the [Discord Rich Library](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/Vermintide-2---Discord-Rich-Presence/releases), you have to do this manually as mods cannot add external libraries to game files...
